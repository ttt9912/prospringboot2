Spring Integration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- enables communication between things that don't want to talk to each other
    (e.g. reactive and non-reactive app)
- enables lightweight messaging within Spring-based applications
- supports integration with external systems via declarative adapters

Facilitates the implementation of integration solutions in applications that are
- scalable
- asynchronous
- event driven
- microservices
- loosely coupled components
- separation of concerns
- shared systems

need to deal with concurrency, multithreading, speed, latency,
